        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my blog post about my school project on [Your Project Topic]. In this post, I'll share what I learned, the challenges I faced, and the outcomes of my project. This project was completed for [Teacher's Name]'s [Subject] class.</p>

        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>The main goal of this project was to utilize an analogue component with an embedded component to create a system that functionally produces and processes audio signals for musical applications. Our system integrates the envelope components of the synthesizer with the touch pads of the drum set to create a model of a DJ set that allows for real-time sound creation and manipulation. This project demonstrates the use of practical applications in circuit design as well as developing and processing audio signals for output, combining analog signal conditioning with digital control systems.</p>
